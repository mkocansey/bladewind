# Releasing BladewindUI

All work happens in **this monorepo**, hosted at **`mkocansey/bladewind`**
(your local clone may sit in a directory called `bladewindui` — that's just a local
folder name; the GitHub remote and the Packagist source are both `mkocansey/bladewind`).
The individual package repos (`mkocansey/bladewind-table` etc.) are **read-only mirrors** — never push to them directly.

> ⚠️ **Never target a split repo named `bladewind`.** That name belongs to *this*
> monorepo's own remote. A matrix entry that splits `packages/meta` into a repo called
> `bladewind` makes the split action force-push filtered subtree history into its own
> parent, overwriting `main` (this happened on 2026-06-08 — `main` was wiped down to
> 3 files and had to be restored from a contributor's local clone). See the note above
> the (deliberately absent) `packages/meta` entry in `split-packages.yml`.

## Root `composer.json` — why it is a `library` with `replace`

The monorepo root is named `mkocansey/bladewind` and declares `type: library` so that
downstream projects can depend on it directly via a Composer **path repository** during
local development:

```json
"repositories": {
    "mkocansey/bladewind": {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "/path/to/bladewindui"
    }
}
```

The `replace` block tells Composer that installing the root package also satisfies every
sub-package requirement (e.g. `mkocansey/bladewind-button ^2.0`), so no network calls
are made for the individual split repos during local dev.

The `extra.laravel.providers` list registers all component service providers so Laravel
auto-discovers them from a single path-repo install.

**On Packagist**, `mkocansey/bladewind` is sourced **directly from this monorepo**
(`github.com/mkocansey/bladewind`) — and has been since 2022 (versions v3.0.10 through
the current release all resolve to this repo's root, per Packagist's own `source.url`
metadata). The root `composer.json` *is* the published full-install package: its
`replace` block declares every granular sub-package at `self.version`, so installing
`mkocansey/bladewind` transparently satisfies `mkocansey/bladewind-button`,
`mkocansey/bladewind-table`, etc. without Composer ever touching the split repos.

`packages/meta` is **intentionally not split** into its own repo — doing so would
require a split target literally named `bladewind`, which collides with this monorepo's
own remote (see the warning above, and the explanatory note in `split-packages.yml`
where that matrix entry would otherwise go).

---

## First-time setup

### 1. Create the split repos on GitHub

Create one empty public repo per package (no README, no licence — keep them completely empty).
There are **44 repos** in total — one per `packages/*` directory plus the full-install meta repo:

```
# Foundation
mkocansey/bladewind-core
mkocansey/bladewind-icon
mkocansey/bladewind-script
mkocansey/bladewind-spinner
mkocansey/bladewind-button
mkocansey/bladewind-alert
mkocansey/bladewind-modal
mkocansey/bladewind-table

# Forms leaf packages
mkocansey/bladewind-input
mkocansey/bladewind-textarea
mkocansey/bladewind-select
mkocansey/bladewind-checkbox
mkocansey/bladewind-radio
mkocansey/bladewind-toggle
mkocansey/bladewind-datepicker
mkocansey/bladewind-timepicker
mkocansey/bladewind-colorpicker
mkocansey/bladewind-filepicker
mkocansey/bladewind-slider
mkocansey/bladewind-checkcards
mkocansey/bladewind-number
mkocansey/bladewind-code

# Forms aggregate (metapackage)
mkocansey/bladewind-forms

# Content leaf packages
mkocansey/bladewind-card
mkocansey/bladewind-contact-card
mkocansey/bladewind-avatar
mkocansey/bladewind-accordion
mkocansey/bladewind-tag
mkocansey/bladewind-timeline
mkocansey/bladewind-statistic
mkocansey/bladewind-rating
mkocansey/bladewind-horizontal-line-graph
mkocansey/bladewind-empty-state
mkocansey/bladewind-centered-content
mkocansey/bladewind-chart
mkocansey/bladewind-progress
mkocansey/bladewind-listview

# Content aggregate (metapackage)
mkocansey/bladewind-content

# Navigation leaf packages
mkocansey/bladewind-tab
mkocansey/bladewind-dropmenu
mkocansey/bladewind-pagination
mkocansey/bladewind-theme-switcher

# Navigation aggregate (metapackage)
mkocansey/bladewind-navigation

# Full-install meta package
mkocansey/bladewind          ← maps to packages/meta/
```

### 2. Add the GitHub Actions secret

In **this monorepo's** Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions, add:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `MONOREPO_SPLIT_TOKEN` | A GitHub personal access token (classic) with `repo` scope, or a fine-grained token with **Contents: Read and write** on all split repos |

### 3. Register each split repo on Packagist

Go to [packagist.org/packages/submit](https://packagist.org/packages/submit) and submit each split repo URL. Enable the GitHub webhook so Packagist auto-updates on new tags.

---

## Day-to-day release flow

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on main and everything is committed
git checkout main && git pull

# 2. Install monorepo-builder (first time only)
composer install

# 3. Validate all package composer.json files are consistent
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder validate

# 4. Release — this command does everything:
#    a) bumps all inter-package version constraints to the new version
#    b) commits the change
#    c) tags the monorepo commit as vX.Y.Z
#    d) pushes the tag to GitHub
#    → GitHub Actions split-packages.yml fires automatically
#    → each packages/* directory is pushed to its read-only repo
#    → the same tag is applied to each split repo
#    → Packagist picks up the new release via webhook
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder release 2.1.0

# 5. Done. Monitor the Actions tab to confirm all 44 splits succeeded.
```

## Semantic versioning rules

- **Patch** (`2.0.x`) — bug fixes, no API changes
- **Minor** (`2.x.0`) — new attributes/features, backward compatible
- **Major** (`x.0.0`) — breaking changes (attribute renamed/removed, SP class moved)

All packages always share the same version number. The monorepo-builder enforces this.

---

## Package architecture

Every component is a **standalone leaf package** that users can install individually:

```
composer require mkocansey/bladewind-accordion   # just accordion
composer require mkocansey/bladewind-table       # just table (pulls exact deps)
```

Three **aggregate metapackages** bundle related components for convenience:

```
composer require mkocansey/bladewind-forms       # all form components
composer require mkocansey/bladewind-content     # all content components
composer require mkocansey/bladewind-navigation  # all navigation components
```

The full install meta-package pulls everything:

```
composer require mkocansey/bladewind             # the whole library
```

Aggregate packages are `type: metapackage` — they contain no code, only a `require` list.

---

## Adding a new component

1. Create `packages/<name>/` with:
   - `composer.json` (name: `mkocansey/bladewind-<name>`, type: `library`) — list only the leaf packages it actually depends on in `require` (grep the blade file for `<x-bladewind::*` to find them)
   - `src/Bladewind<Name>ServiceProvider.php` — use the `is_dir()` guard pattern for `bladewind-public` (see below)
   - `config/bladewind.php` (just this component's config keys)
   - `resources/views/components/` (blade files)

2. Add to root `composer.json` — three places:
   - `autoload.psr-4`: `"Mkocansey\\Bladewind\\<Name>\\": "packages/<name>/src/"`
   - `replace`: `"mkocansey/bladewind-<name>": "self.version"`
   - `extra.laravel.providers`: `"Mkocansey\\Bladewind\\<Name>\\Bladewind<Name>ServiceProvider"`

3. Add a matrix entry to `.github/workflows/split-packages.yml`:
   ```yaml
   - { local_path: 'packages/<name>', split_repository: 'bladewind-<name>' }
   ```

4. If the component belongs to a group (forms/content/navigation), add it to the relevant `packages/<group>/composer.json` `require`

5. Add it to `packages/meta/composer.json` `require` (or it'll be pulled transitively via the group)

6. Add its config keys to `packages/meta/config/bladewind.php`

7. Create the empty GitHub repo `mkocansey/bladewind-<name>`

8. Register it on Packagist with a GitHub webhook

9. Release a new minor version

### Service provider template for new components

Use this exact pattern — the `is_dir()` guards prevent errors when a package has no CSS or no `public/` directory:

```php
<?php

namespace Mkocansey\Bladewind\<Name>;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class Bladewind<Name>ServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->mergeConfigFrom(__DIR__.'/../config/bladewind.php', 'bladewind');
    }

    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->loadViewsFrom(__DIR__.'/../resources/views', 'bladewind');

        $this->publishes([
            __DIR__.'/../resources/views/components/' => resource_path('views/components/bladewind'),
        ], 'bladewind-components');

        $bladewindPublicPaths = [];
        if (is_dir(__DIR__.'/../resources/assets/css')) {
            $bladewindPublicPaths[__DIR__.'/../resources/assets/css/'] = public_path('vendor/bladewind/css');
        }
        if (is_dir(__DIR__.'/../public')) {
            $bladewindPublicPaths[__DIR__.'/../public/'] = public_path('vendor/bladewind');
        }
        if (!empty($bladewindPublicPaths)) {
            $this->publishes($bladewindPublicPaths, 'bladewind-public');
        }
    }
}
```
